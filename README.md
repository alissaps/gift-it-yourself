## About the project
In this project, the objective was to develop in one week a React Web Application with a fully functioning CRUD. With the approaching Christmas, our idea was to create a website with Do It Yourself projects so the people can find ways to make gifts with their own hands. Besides finding gift ideas, one can add gift instructions, edit or delete them, and also generate cool celebration messages. We call it "Gift It Yourself"!
